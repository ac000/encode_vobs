encode_vobs
===========

A simple job scheduler to encode DVD VOB files into Ogg Theora, WebM or
Matroska (containing VP8 + AC3) format.

It creates nr cores - 1 (over-ridable with the -t option),
ffmpeg2theora/ffmpeg processes at a time, running them at nice +10
(over-ridable with the -n option).

Usage is like (pass -h for full help):

    $ cd /path/to/vobs
    $ encode_vobs -P webm file1.vob ...

to encode to WebM format, specify -P theora for Ogg Theora format and -P mkv
for Matroska.

When using the mkv profile, it expects a VOB containing the video as the
first track and the audio you want as the second (extra audio tracks will be
ignored). You can optionally pass -a <audio ID> to specify which audio track
you wish to use from the VOB.

You can also optionally pass the full path to an executable that you would
like to have run after every file is encoded with the -e option. This can be
a binary or script of some sort, it will be called with the newly encoded
file name as argv[1].
