encode_vobs
===========

A simple job scheduler to encode DVD VOB files into Ogg Theora.

It forks/execs (3) ffmpeg2theora processes at a time.

I use 3 as that is 1 less than the number of cores I have. It runs the encoder
proccesses at nice +10.

Usage is like:

    $ cd /path/to/vobs
    $ encode_vobs file1.vob ...

Change the NR_WORKERS define to suit your situation.
